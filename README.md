## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot token | - | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `TARGET_ROLE_NAME` | Role name to target for disconnection | TimeTracked | ‚ùå No |
| `DISCONNECT_TIME` | Time in UTC (HH:MM format) | 03:00 | ‚ùå No |
| `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID` | Channel ID for notifications | - | ‚ùå No |
| `TARGET_VOICE_CHANNELS` | Comma-separated voice channel IDs | All channels | ‚ùå No |

### Example Configuration

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token_here
TARGET_ROLE_NAME=NightOwl
DISCONNECT_TIME=02:30
NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890123456789
TARGET_VOICE_CHANNELS=1111111111111111111,2222222222222222222
```

## Commands

### `!status`
*Requires Administrator permission*

Displays the current bot status and configuration.

```
!status
```

### `!testdisconnect`
*Requires Administrator permission*

Manually triggers a disconnection event for testing purposes.

```
!testdisconnect
```

## How It Works

1. The bot connects to Discord and starts a scheduled task
2. Every minute, it checks if the current UTC time matches the configured `DISCONNECT_TIME`
3. When the time matches:
   - The bot searches for all users with the `TARGET_ROLE_NAME` in voice channels
   - If `TARGET_VOICE_CHANNELS` is configured, only those channels are checked
   - All matching users are disconnected from voice channels
   - A notification is sent to the configured notification channel (if set)

## Example Use Cases

- **Gaming Community**: Disconnect users at 3 AM to enforce server downtime
- **Study Group**: Automatically end study sessions at a specific time
- **Corporate Server**: Enforce off-hours policies for voice channels
- **Event Management**: Clear voice channels after scheduled events

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't connect
- Verify your `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correct
- Check that the bot is invited to your server
- Ensure you have enabled required intents in Discord Developer Portal

### Users not disconnecting
- Verify the role name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that the bot has "Move Members" permission
- Ensure the bot's role is higher than the target role in the role hierarchy
- Verify the disconnect time is in UTC (not your local timezone)

### Notifications not sending
- Check that `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID` is correct
- Ensure the bot has permission to send messages in that channel
- Verify the bot has "Embed Links" permission
